# Introduction

We are currently in the age of AI. AI is now mainstream and can be found everywhere. Wherever you go, you must hear about AI. Its impact is clearly visible, but there's one problem. No, the problem isn't the Terminator or a robot invasion ðŸ¤ž. The problem is accessibility for those curious about the field.

Learning AI/ML has been very daunting because the biggest problem is deciding where to start. It is even more daunting now because more and more layers have been added to the field. The field is growing at a fast pace. Courses become outdated in less than 3 months ðŸ˜…. New advancements are coming out almost every weekend. This has made AI more difficult than ever to learn or break into, especially for beginners.

To solve this problem, I decided to create this site. It is not a course itself but more of a guide that would point you in the right direction when you are learning or trying to update your knowledge. I hope you find it useful.
